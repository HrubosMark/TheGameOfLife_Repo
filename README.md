## The original Concept

**The Game of Life** is a grid based simulation invented by John Conway in 1970. The simulation displays a grid-based world where cells live and die according to specific rules. The simulation, "life" emerges in the grid, forming various patterns.

## Our version

**Our simulation** models an ecosystem within a rectangular grid where grass, rabbits, and foxes interact. Each species has specific behaviors for growth, movement, and reproduction, with turn-based mechanics governing the systemâ€™s evolution over time. 

## Requirements

- .NET SDK: .NET 8.0 or newer version
- Operation system: Windows, Linux or macOS
